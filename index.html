        <h4>What does it mean to you to live the life of your dreams?</h4>
        <p id="first-pera">What would you do if you knew your dreams will come true? If there was no risk of failure?
            Free up your mind and think about all the infinite possibilities life gives us. Don’t limit yourself while
            you are dreaming. When I started writing down my dreams, I thought my dreams were too big. I thought they
            were impossible. But you know what? Nothing is impossible. Don’t constrain yourself by what you think or
            what other people think. Put aside all the doubts you have, and begin dreaming!</p>
